Display the contents of certain text files in a solution folder in a pop-up when the solution is opened.

If a file called SolutionOpenPopUp.txt and/or ReadMe.txt exists in the root folder of the solution, the contents are shown in a pop-up when the solution is open - a handy way to share solution-specific gotchas, non-critical team messages, etc with colleagues and contributors.

For example:

 - You're new to a company, have made some notes on a .Net solution, and it would be useful to see the notes each time you open the solution.

 - You are planning to upgrade a solution to VS2017 in the next quarter, and you want to give the developers a heads up whenever they open the solution.

 - The solution has some 'gotchas' (e.g. compilation, runtime or unit test related) which interested parties would benefit from seeing whenever they open up the code.  

 - The solution is simply a proof of concept and you wish to convey this to others.
 
 - Your solution has its' own "ReadMe" file which all developers should view when they open the solution.
 
 - You want to share a joke-of-the-day or coder-of-the-week announcement with colleagues.
