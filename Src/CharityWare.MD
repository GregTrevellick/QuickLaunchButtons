### Charity Ware

- This software should be considered [CharityWare](http://charityware.info/).

- The [CharityWare](http://charityware.info/) status does NOT form part of the software licence agreement. 

- It simply means that if you get any benefit at all from this software I kindly request that you make a donation of whatever amount you like to whatever charity you like. 

- It is entirely voluntary and unless you inform me (please do!) I will never know if you made a donation.

- Put simply, a little currency to charity is much better than lots of currency to me.
