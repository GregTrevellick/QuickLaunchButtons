## Use Cases

When you only rarely need to launch [Fiddler][ThirdPartyAppHomePage] you may wish to disable the toolbar, to avoid cluttering up the IDE.

When you need to launch [Fiddler][ThirdPartyAppHomePage] on an ad-hoc basis you may wish to use the Tools menu option, rather than enable and subsequently disable the toolbar.

When you need to repeatedly launch [Fiddler][ThirdPartyAppHomePage] to solve a problem you may wish to enable the toolbar, allowing instant access to launch [Fiddler][ThirdPartyAppHomePage], and once the problem is solved disable the toolbar, to avoid cluttering up the IDE.

Or, of course, you may wish to keep the toolbar permanently enabled.

## External Tools

This extension is similar to Visual Studio's [External Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/ide/managing-external-tools) functionality. [External Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/ide/managing-external-tools) is more feature-rich (e.g allows specification of arguments) but does not associate an icon and creates a tools menu option only, not a toolbar as well.
